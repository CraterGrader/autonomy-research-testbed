##### Supports
The supports are spaced to be mounted to the metal base plate of the car and have easy mounting to the board.

##### Lidar Mount
The Lidar was to be above the rest of the components so nothing would get in the way. The mount raises the lidar high enough and is study to hold the lidar in place.

##### Camera Mounts
These mounts give the ability to change the angle of the cameras vertically and horizontally. The connection point is to a GoPro style connector mount.
This is the link to the [Camera Mount] that was used.
